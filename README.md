# CraigSail.py

**Track craigslist items and use statistical patterns to optimize sales and purchases.**

Have you ever wanted to use Craigslist to:
- search multiple cities at once for the same type of product? 
- track the price of your item and get alerts when the price reaches your buy level?
- benchmark prices for the same or similar products in your area?
- talk to a craigslist expert to find deals or post your items for sale?

Craigsail will let you do all of this with the added benefit of visualizing prices and locations on a map. Use the AI chat bot to interact with Craigslist postings and get AI-recommended buy / sell info. You are in the driver's seat now.

Hooks in to https://github.com/juliomalegria/python-craigslist API with added capabilities.
